# Logic-Gates

## Binary switches

- Electronic devices can only recognise the presence or absence of a current
- Computer comprise billions of switches which can be either on or off.
- These switches can be combined in different ways to create simple circuits called logic gates.

### Logic gates

- Electronic logic gates take one or more inputs and produce a single output
- The output can then become the input to the next gate, and so on to create a complex circuit.
- NOT, AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR
- Each of these symbols can be represented by a graphical symbol and truth table.

### NOT gate
- If 0 is input it outputs 1
- If 1 is input it outputs 0

### AND gate
- If both inputs are 1 then the output is 1
- Otherwise the output is 0

### OR gate
- If either input is 1 then the output is 1
- Otherwise the output is 0

## Creating logic circuits

- Multiple logic gates can be connected to produce an output based on multiple inputs.
